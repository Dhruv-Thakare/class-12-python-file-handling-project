## 📋 Project Question

> Write a menu-driven Python program to:
>
> 1. Create a file `textfile.txt`
> 2. Open and display its content

## 💡 What the Program Does

### ✅ Create a File
- Creates `textfile.txt` and lets you type in content.

### ✅ Open a File
- Shows everything written in `textfile.txt`.

### ✅ Append Data
- Adds new lines to `textfile.txt` without deleting the old content.

### ✅ Count Stats
- Finds how many lines begin with `W` or `H`
- Counts the total number of words
- Finds words starting with `T` or `t`
- Counts all 5-letter words

### ✅ Copy Filtered File
- Takes lines from `source.txt`
- Skips lines that begin with `@`
- Saves the rest to `target.txt`
